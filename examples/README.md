# Examples and Demos

This directory contains example scripts and demonstrations of jsonl-algebra functionality.

## Files

### Streaming Demos
- `streaming_demo.py` - Basic demonstration of streaming operations
- `streaming_comprehensive_demo.py` - Comprehensive examples of streaming features
- `simple_streaming_test.py` - Simple tests for streaming functionality

### Testing Scripts
- `test_streaming_warnings.py` - Tests for memory usage warnings
- `test_windowed_processing.py` - Tests for windowed processing features

## Running Examples

To run any of these examples:

```bash
# Run from the project root
python examples/streaming_demo.py

# Or make them executable
chmod +x examples/streaming_demo.py
./examples/streaming_demo.py
```

These examples demonstrate:
- Memory-efficient streaming operations
- Windowed processing for large datasets
- Warning systems for memory-intensive operations
- Performance comparisons between streaming and non-streaming modes

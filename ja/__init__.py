"""JSONL Algebra: Your Command-Line Toolkit for JSONL Data.

Welcome to `ja`! This package provides a powerful and intuitive suite of tools
for performing relational algebra on JSONL data, right from your command line
or in your Python scripts. Think of it as a `sed` / `awk` / `grep` for structured
JSON, designed to be both powerful for complex tasks and simple for everyday use.

Whether you need to filter a massive log file, join two datasets, reshape a
complex nested JSON structure, or simply explore your data, `ja` has your back.

Core Features:

- **Relational Operations**: `select`, `project`, `join`, `union`, `difference`,
  `distinct`, and more, all supporting nested data via dot notation.
- **Powerful Aggregation**: A `groupby` command to summarize and aggregate your data.
- **Schema Inference**: Automatically generate a JSON Schema to understand your
  data's structure.
- **Format Conversion**: Easily import from CSV or directories of JSON and export
  to CSV.
- **Interactive REPL**: An interactive shell to build data pipelines step-by-step.

Get started with the `ja` command-line tool or import functions directly into
your Python code.

Example:
    >>> from ja.core import select, project
    >>> data = [{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}, {"name": "Bob", "age": 25}]
    >>> young_people = select(data, "age < 30")
    >>> names_only = project(young_people, ["name"])
    >>> print(list(names_only))
    [{'name': 'Bob'}]
